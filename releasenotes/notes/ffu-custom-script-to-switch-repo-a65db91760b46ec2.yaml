    the interface.

        #!/bin/bash
        case $1 in
          ocata)
            curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/ocata.repo http://somewhere.com/my-Ocata.repo;
            yum clean metadata;
          pike)
            curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/pike.repo http://somewhere.com/my-Pike.repo;
            yum clean metadata;
          *)
            echo "unknown release $1" >&2
            exit 1
